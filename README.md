## **1. User Management**

> **Admin Area**  
> In the site’s admin area, you can manage users extensively—listing all registered users, editing their details, and assigning them to one or more roles. This area is designed to streamline administrative tasks and ensure that only authorized users can access privileged information.

1. **User Registration & Authentication**
    
    - **Password Validation**: Enforced with configurable strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, uppercase, special characters).
    - **Email Verification**: Tokens for account activation, ensuring legitimate user sign-ups.
    - **JWT-Based Authentication** and **Refresh Tokens**: Provides secure, stateless sessions.
    - **Password Reset**: Initiated via email, featuring verification tokens to prevent unauthorized resets.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    
    - **Predefined Roles**: Out-of-the-box roles such as Admin, NewUser, and User.
    - **Custom Role Creation**: Admins can create and define new roles to fit various organizational needs.
    - **Role Assignment & Update**: Easily assign or modify roles to implement fine-grained user permissions.

---

## **2. Resource Management**

> **Admin Area**  
> In addition to user management, the admin area also includes a **Settings** section to handle defaults for the website (though the core application doesn’t use these settings by default, they’re available for customization in any derived project).

1. **Resource Types**
    
    - **Files, APIs, Internal Tools**: Manage access or permissions to different resource categories, ensuring only authorized roles can utilize critical resources.
2. **Management Features**
    
    - **Settings Management**: Global or per-user settings can be managed in the admin area. These defaults are placeholders for any future website-specific features.
    - **Session Management**: Admins can monitor and invalidate active user sessions if suspicious activity is detected.
    - **Email Service**: Comes with built-in functionality for sending notifications, account verification links, and password reset emails.
    - **Extensibility**: The system is designed so new resource types or management features can be plugged in easily.

---

## **3. Notification System**

> **Admin Area**  
> A dedicated **Notification Section** provides templates to send messages to users. Administrators can broadcast alerts, announcements, or customized updates directly through the application.

- **Built-In Notifications**: A straightforward interface for composing and dispatching notifications to user groups or individual accounts.

---

## **4. Settings Management**

- **Global & User-Specific Settings**: Administrators can define site-wide defaults while users can customize their own settings without affecting others.
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: Settings can be structured in a parent-child hierarchy to keep configurations organized and easy to maintain.

> Note:  
> The application itself doesn’t rely heavily on these settings by default. They’re present for whatever direction you want to take the project (e.g., adding new services, toggling experimental features, etc.).

---

## **5. Reporting & Analytics**

> **Logging System**  
> “The logging system is very complex and awesome. It uses chained hashes to create a tamper-proof system, making logs extremely difficult to alter retroactively. On top of that, the project closely follows **HIPAA** and **GDPR** standards, ensuring data is handled securely and compliantly.”

1. **Usage Reports**: Gain insight into how users are interacting with resources and which features they utilize most frequently.
2. **Audit Logs**:
    - **Tamper-Proof**: Chained hashing of logs ensures any tampering is easily detectable.
    - **Filtering & Viewing**: In the admin area, you can filter logs by user ID, request ID, connection ID, correlation ID, and time range. The system will retrieve up to the first 2,000 logs after the specified start time.
    - **Compliance-Ready**: Built with security and privacy regulations (like HIPAA/GDPR) in mind.

---

## **6. Security Measures**

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
    
    - **JWT Tokens**: Stateless tokens for secure user sessions.
    - **RBAC**: Enforces granular access controls.
2. **Password Management**
    
    - **PBKDF2 Hashing + Salt**: All passwords stored securely in a one-way hashed format.
    - **Configurable Complexity**: Admins can require varying levels of password strength.
3. **Token Management**
    
    - **Token Revocation**: Immediately invalidate compromised or no-longer-needed tokens.
    - **Token Expiration**: Enforce automatic session expiration to limit token misuse over time.
4. **Email Verification**
    
    - **Verification Tokens**: Protects against fraudulent accounts and supports secure password reset workflows.
5. **Data Encryption**
    
    - **Encryption at Rest**: Passwords and tokens are hashed in storage.
    - **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS ensures all data is protected while traveling between client and server.
6. **Key Management**
    
    - **Scheduled Key Rotation**: Uses Hangfire to rotate secret keys every 24 hours automatically.
    - **Secure Key Storage**: Keys are loaded and cached in memory to avoid accidental exposure.
7. **Compliance Practices**
    
    - **Data Protection**: No plain-text credentials or tokens are ever stored.
    - **Audit Logging**: Integral to meeting GDPR/HIPAA requirements, with a robust system to track and verify log integrity.

---

## **7. Scalability & Performance**

1. **Scalable Architecture**
    
    - **Microservices**: Services can be scaled independently.
    - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic efficiently.
    - **MariaDB Replication/Sharding**: Supports horizontal database scaling.
    - **Containerization**: Isolated Docker or similar environments for faster, more flexible deployments.
2. **Performance Optimization**
    
    - **Frontend**: Lazy loading, HTTP caching, code minification, and bundling.
    - **Backend**: Caching (e.g., Redis), database indexing, asynchronous I/O, and connection pooling.
3. **Monitoring & Metrics**
    
    - **APM**: Tools like New Relic or Application Insights for real-time performance data.
    - **Logging**: Detailed logs using Serilog, NLog, or a similar framework.
    - **Metrics Collection**: Track CPU/memory usage with Prometheus, Grafana, or analogous solutions.
