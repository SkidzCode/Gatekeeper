    - **JWT Tokens**: GateKeeper uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Access tokens and refresh tokens are generated and validated to ensure secure user sessions.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: User roles are managed and assigned to control access to different parts of the application.
2. **Password Management**:
    
    - **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with a salt before storing them in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the actual passwords are not exposed.
    - **Password Strength Validation**: Passwords are validated for strength based on configurable criteria such as minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
3. **Token Management**:
    
    - **Token Revocation**: Tokens can be revoked to log out users or invalidate sessions, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access.
    - **Token Expiration**: Tokens have expiration times to limit the duration of their validity, reducing the risk of token misuse.
4. **Email Verification**:
    
    - **Verification Tokens**: Email verification tokens are generated and sent to users to verify their email addresses during registration and password reset processes.

### Data Encryption

1. **Encryption at Rest**:
    
    - **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with a salt, ensuring that stored passwords are not in plain text.
    - **Token Storage**: Verification tokens are hashed before being stored in the database.
2. **Encryption in Transit**:
    
    - **HTTPS**: The application is configured to use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring that sensitive information such as login credentials and tokens are protected during transmission.

### Compliance Standards

While the current documentation does not explicitly mention adherence to specific compliance standards such as GDPR or HIPAA, the following practices indicate a focus on security and privacy:

1. **Data Protection**:
    
    - **Password Hashing and Token Management**: These practices align with general data protection principles by ensuring that sensitive information is not stored in plain text and is protected against unauthorized access.
2. **User Consent and Verification**:
    
    - **Email Verification**: Verifying user email addresses helps ensure that users have control over their accounts and that unauthorized access is minimized.
3. **Configurable Security Settings**:
    
    - **Password Strength Configuration**: Allowing configurable password strength criteria helps meet various compliance requirements by enforcing strong password policies.

To fully comply with standards like GDPR or HIPAA, additional measures such as data access controls, audit logs, data minimization, and user consent management would need to be implemented and documented.

### Summary

GateKeeper implements several security protocols to protect user data and access, including JWT-based authentication, password hashing, token management, and email verification. Data encryption is handled through password hashing for data at rest and HTTPS for data in transit. While the documentation does not explicitly state compliance with standards like GDPR or HIPAA, the security practices in place suggest a strong focus on data protection and privacy.

## Scalability and Performance

### Scalability Design

**Architecture** GateKeeper is designed to handle an increasing number of users and resources through several architectural strategies:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: The application is divided into multiple services, each responsible for a specific functionality. This allows individual services to be scaled independently based on demand.
2. **Load Balancing**: Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck. This helps in maintaining high availability and reliability.
3. **Database Scalability**: The use of MariaDB 10, which supports replication and sharding, allows the database to scale horizontally. This means that as the number of users grows, additional database instances can be added to handle the increased load.
4. **Containerization**: Using Docker or similar containerization technologies, each service can be deployed in isolated environments, making it easier to manage dependencies and scale services.

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend Optimization**

1. **Lazy Loading**: Angular's lazy loading feature is used to load modules only when they are needed, reducing the initial load time and improving the application's performance.
2. **HTTP Caching**: The frontend leverages HTTP caching to store responses from the backend, reducing the number of network requests and improving load times.
3. **Minification and Bundling**: JavaScript and CSS files are minified and bundled to reduce the size of the files that need to be downloaded by the client, improving load times.

**Backend Optimization**

1. **Caching Strategies**: The backend uses caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to query the database repeatedly. This can be implemented using in-memory data stores like Redis.
2. **Database Indexing**: Indexes are created on frequently queried columns in the MariaDB database to speed up data retrieval operations.
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Asynchronous programming is used to handle I/O-bound operations, such as database queries and network requests, without blocking the main thread. This improves the responsiveness of the application.
4. **Connection Pooling**: Database connection pooling is used to reuse existing database connections, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections and improving performance.

### Monitoring and Metrics

**Tools and Systems**

1. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Tools like New Relic or Application Insights can be integrated to monitor the performance and health of the application. These tools provide insights into response times, error rates, and resource usage.
2. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is implemented using libraries like Serilog or NLog. Logs are collected and analyzed to identify performance bottlenecks and errors.
3. **Health Checks**: Regular health checks are performed to ensure that all services are running as expected. This can be implemented using ASP.NET Core's health check middleware.
4. **Metrics Collection**: Metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and request rates are collected using tools like Prometheus and visualized using Grafana. This helps in identifying trends and potential issues before they impact users.

By employing these strategies and tools, GateKeeper is well-equipped to handle scalability and performance challenges, ensuring a robust and reliable application for managing and securing access to resources.
