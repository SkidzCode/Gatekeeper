### Database Setup

GateKeeper uses a **MariaDB 10** database to store and manage data. Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. **Start MariaDB Server**

   Ensure that your MariaDB server is running. You can start it using the command line or through your preferred database management tool.

2. **Create the Database**

   Log into MariaDB and create a new database for GateKeeper:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE gatekeeper_db;
   ```

3. **Initialize Database Scripts**

   The `scripts` folder contains multiple SQL scripts necessary for setting up the database. It includes:

   - **Init.sql**: Sets up the API user with the minimal required permissions. **Important:** Before running this script, you need to edit it to configure the API user's credentials and permissions as per your environment.

   - **Table Scripts**: Multiple scripts located in `scripts/tables` directory to create the necessary tables.

   - **Stored Procedure Scripts**: Multiple scripts located in `scripts/stored_procedures` directory to create stored procedures.

   - **Seed Scripts**: Located in the `scripts/seed` directory to populate the database with initial data.

4. **Edit `Init.sql`**

   Open the `Init.sql` file located in the `scripts` folder and update the API user credentials and permissions to match your security requirements.

5. **Run Init.sql**

   Execute the `Init.sql` script to set up the API user:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p gatekeeper_db < scripts/Init.sql
   ```

6. **Run Table Scripts**

   Execute all table creation scripts located in the `scripts/tables` directory:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p gatekeeper_db < scripts/tables/create_tables.sql
   ```

   *(If there are multiple table scripts, you can run them sequentially or create a script to execute all of them at once.)*

7. **Execute Stored Procedures**

   Run the stored procedures scripts located in the `scripts/stored_procedures` directory:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p gatekeeper_db < scripts/stored_procedures/create_procedures.sql
   ```

8. **Seed Initial Data**

   Populate the database with initial data by running the seed scripts:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p gatekeeper_db < scripts/seed/seed_data.sql
   ```

## Configuration

Proper configuration is crucial for GateKeeper to function correctly. This section covers the necessary configuration steps.

### Using Manager User Secrets

GateKeeper utilizes the **Manager User Secrets** feature to manage sensitive information and configuration settings securely. This approach ensures that sensitive data such as API keys, connection strings, and passwords are not hard-coded or exposed in configuration files.

#### Steps to Configure Using Manager User Secrets

1. **Navigate to the Backend Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd GateKeeper.Server
   ```

2. **Initialize User Secrets**

   If you haven't already initialized user secrets for the project, run the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets init
   ```

   This command creates a `UserSecretsId` in your `.csproj` file, enabling the use of user secrets.

3. **Set the Required Secrets**

   Add the necessary configuration settings using the `dotnet user-secrets` command. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details.

   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SmtpHost" "server.url.or.ip"
   dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Port" "587"
   dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:UserName" "your_email@example.com"
   dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Password" "your_email_password"
   dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:FromName" "GateKeeper Notifications"
   dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:UseSsl" "true"

   dotnet user-secrets set "JwtConfig:Secret" "SuperSecretKeyThatIsVeryLongAndSecure"
   dotnet user-secrets set "JwtConfig:Issuer" "GateKeeperIssuer"
   dotnet user-secrets set "JwtConfig:Audience" "GateKeeperAudience"
   dotnet user-secrets set "JwtConfig:ExpirationMinutes" "60"

   dotnet user-secrets set "DatabaseConfig:Server" "localhost"
   dotnet user-secrets set "DatabaseConfig:Database" "gatekeeper_db"
   dotnet user-secrets set "DatabaseConfig:User" "api_user"
   dotnet user-secrets set "DatabaseConfig:Password" "your_db_password"

   dotnet user-secrets set "Logging:LogLevel:Default" "Information"
   dotnet user-secrets set "Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft" "Warning"
   dotnet user-secrets set "Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime" "Information"

   dotnet user-secrets set "AllowedHosts" "*"
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - Ensure that all sensitive information is set using user secrets and not hard-coded in `appsettings.json`.
   - The application is already configured to read these settings from user secrets, so there's no need to modify `appsettings.json` for sensitive data.

4. **Verify User Secrets Configuration**

   Ensure that your application is set up to read from user secrets. Typically, in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`, the configuration is already set to include user secrets in the development environment:

   ```csharp
   if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
   {
       builder.Configuration.AddUserSecrets<Program>();
   }
   ```

   This setup allows the application to securely access the configuration settings during development.

### Environment Variables

Sensitive information and environment-specific configurations can also be managed using environment variables to enhance security and flexibility.

1. **Set Environment Variables**

   Depending on your operating system, set the necessary environment variables. For example, on Windows:

   ```powershell
   $env:JWT_SECRET="YourSuperSecretKey"
   $env:DB_PASSWORD="YourDbPassword"
   ```

2. **Modify Configuration to Use Environment Variables**

   While GateKeeper primarily uses user secrets for managing sensitive configurations, you can also configure it to read from environment variables if needed. This step is optional and depends on your deployment strategy.

3. **Use a Configuration Provider**

   Ensure that your application is set up to read environment variables. In ASP.NET Core, this is typically handled automatically, but verify your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` to confirm.
